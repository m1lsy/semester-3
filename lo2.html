            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Throughout the semester, I’ve consistently used version control to manage and maintain my work—particularly through Git and GitHub. At the start of the course, I set up a dedicated Git repository for my portfolio project and made it a habit to commit regularly. This helped me keep track of my progress, test new features safely, and backtrack when needed. Each commit was made with clear, descriptive messages that reflected the changes accurately, such as:<br> 'added project tile layout' or 'fixing link styling.'</p>
                <p>I plan to further improve my commit messages in the future by making an effort to use consistent prefixes by adoping a convention like feat:, fix:, docs:, etc., to categorize commits.</p><br>
                <p>In terms of deployment, I chose to host my website using GitHub Pages. While our course typically uses Hera, I previously experienced technical issues with it, and instead of waiting for a fix, I proactively researched and implemented GitHub Pages as an alternative. This decision not only gave me more control over deployment, but also highlighted my ability to find and apply solutions independently—an essential skill when working in development environments.</p><br>

                <h2>Version Control Challenges</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>During my portfolio creation process, I encountered a significant challenge with version control when I accidentally committed a large video file that was over GitHub’s 100MB file size limit. This caused my push to GitHub to be rejected, blocking all future updates to the repository.</p>
                <br>
                <p>WHAT WENT WRONG:</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                    <li>I added and committed a .mov file that was 129MB, exceeding GitHub’s hard limit.</li>
                    <li>Pushing failed repeatedly with errors suggesting Git Large File Storage (LFS), but I chose not to use LFS.</li>
                    <li>I tried to remove the file using git-filter-repo, but it refused to run on a non-fresh repo without a --force flag.</li>
                    <li>After forcing it, I successfully removed the large file — but this also wiped my remote (origin) configuration, which meant my repo no longer knew where to push.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>HOW I SOLVED IT:</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                    <li>Removed the large file from history using:<br><code>git filter-repo --path prototype-mockup-video.mov --invert-paths --force</code></li>
                    <li>Reconnected the remote repository after it was auto-removed:<br><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/m1lsy/semester-3.git</code></li>
                    <li>Forced a push to update the remote with the cleaned repository:<br><code>git push --force origin main</code></li>
                    <li>I made sure to compress the videos and images in order to still have them on my website</li>
                </ul>
        
                <p>KEY TAKEAWAYS:</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                    <li>GitHub has a hard limit of 100MB per file — not just a warning.</li>
                    <li>Large binary files like videos should never be committed directly unless using a solution like Git LFS (which wasn't necessary here).</li>
                    <li><code>git filter-repo</code> is powerful for rewriting history but should be used cautiously.</li>
                    <li>After rewriting history, you must re-add the remote before pushing.</li>
                    <li>Always double-check what’s being committed with <code>git status</code> and <code>.gitignore</code> files.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Collaboration & Team Workflow</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Collaborating with four teammates on a coding project was a valuable experience that taught me the importance of teamwork and communication in software development. We used GitLab as our version control platform, which allowed us to define clear tasks and assign them to individual team members. Each of us worked in our own branches to ensure that our changes were isolated and did not interfere with others' work. Regular check-ins were scheduled to discuss progress, address challenges, and merge completed features into the main branch. This structured workflow helped us stay organized and ensured that everyone contributed effectively to the project.</p><br>
                <p>One of the key challenges we faced was managing merge conflicts, especially when multiple team members were working on similar files. To resolve these conflicts, we communicated closely and used GitLab's merge request features to review each other's code before merging. This not only helped us maintain code quality but also allowed us to learn from each other's approaches and solutions.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, this collaborative experience reinforced my understanding of version control systems and the importance of clear communication in a team setting. It also highlighted the need for flexibility and adaptability when working with others, as we had to adjust our plans based on each other's progress and feedback.</p><br>

                <h2>Tile Grid Breakdown</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>To create a dynamic and visually engaging way to showcase my Projects and Learning Outcomes, I developed a custom JavaScript tile grid system. Below is a breakdown of how it works:</p><br>
                
                <p>DATA-DRIVEN DESIGN</p>
                <p>All tile content is defined in two structured arrays: <code>projects</code> and <code>learningOutcomes</code>. Each object includes:</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                    <li><strong>title</strong>: the name of the item</li>
                    <li><strong>link</strong>: the destination URL</li>
                    <li><strong>image</strong>: the preview image</li>
                    <li><strong>size</strong>: custom height (<code>short</code>, <code>medium</code>, or <code>tall</code>) for layout variation</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>DYNAMIC RENDERING WITH <code>renderTiles()</code></p>
                <p>This function dynamically builds and displays tiles based on which dataset is currently active. Key features:</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                    <li><strong>Clears</strong> the existing tile grid</li>
                    <li><strong>Selects</strong> either <code>projects</code> or <code>learningOutcomes</code> using a toggle flag</li>
                    <li><strong>Loops</strong> through the data and builds HTML elements on the fly</li>
                    <li><strong>Uses</strong> <code>DocumentFragment</code> for better performance (less reflow/repaint)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>INTERACTIVITY WITH EVENT LISTENERS</p>
                <p>User can toggle between sections using:</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                    <li>A <strong>toggle button</strong></li>
                    <li>Navigation links (<code>Projects</code> and <code>Learning Outcomes</code>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These update the UI state (<code>showingProjects</code>) and re-render the tiles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>PAGE LOAD INITIALIZATION</p>
                <p>To ensure everything displays correctly when the page loads, I call <code>renderTiles()</code> once on <code>DOMContentLoaded</code>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Why This Matters</p>
                <ul class="dash-list">
                    <li><strong>Clean structure</strong>: Separates data, rendering logic, and UI behavior</li>
                    <li><strong>Reusable logic</strong>: One rendering function handles both projects and learning outcomes</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance-aware</strong>: Uses <code>DocumentFragment</code> and <code>loading="lazy"</code></li>
                    <li><strong>Responsive-ready</strong>: Uses tile sizing logic (<code>gridRowEnd</code>) to create a visually diverse layout</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>This feature highlights my ability to write scalable, maintainable JavaScript to build interactive and modular front-end components.</p><br>
