                <p>Hello! I’m Mila Pulvirenti — 20, South African, currently living in Eindhoven and studying ICT & Media Design. This portfolio is a presentation of my work over the course of Semester 3 and shows where my passions for both Technology and Creativity meet.</p><br>
                <p>I grew up in a tech-driven home, with a dad and brother in the industry, so things like new gadgets, software, and digital thinking were always around. But, I’ve also always been drawn to design — visual language, storytelling, the power of aesthetics. For me, it’s never been one or the other — it’s about blending both to create something that works and looks good doing it.</p><br>
                <p>Since moving to Europe, travel has become a big part of my life as it is now easier than ever living in a location that is so connected to different parts of the world. Cities like Berlin, London, Antwerp and Dublin have given me fresh perspectives, inspiration and creative energy that I bring into my projects.</p><br>
                <p>Outside of school, I work part-time at LAB-1, a retro cinema. Balancing work and study keeps me grounded and has taught me a lot, especially how to manage my time and push through challenges without losing momentum.</p><br>
                <p>This portfolio is a reflection of what I care about — thoughtful design, smart solutions, and finding creative ways to bring ideas to life.</p>
