                <p>STUDIO KROM</p><br>
                <p>To maintain a professional relationship with our client, Studio Krom, we held biweekly check-ins to keep them informed about our progress and gather feedback. I took on the communication role within our team, serving as the main point of contact with Joris from Krom. This involved managing scheduling, sharing updates, and coordinating meetings through WhatsApp and email. As a team, we made a consistent effort to show up prepared â€” always punctual, fully present, and organized. To ensure a focused environment for these sessions, we proactively booked meeting rooms rather than using the often noisy OIL space. We also prepared visual presentations to clearly communicate our work and facilitate productive discussions. </p>

                <p>In addition to our client meetings, we also had regular check ins with our project coaches in order to get feedback as a group but also on an individual basis, in between portfolio reviews. This feedback was always regularly logged into Feedpulse in order to keep track of our progress and refer back to when needed. </p><br>

                <p>At the start of the project, we used Trello to divide tasks and track progress. However, after receiving feedback from our coaches, we recognized the need for a more structured and professional tool, so we transitioned to Jira. This allowed us to better align with industry standards for digital project management, offering more advanced features for task assignment, sprint planning, and backlog organization. Alongside this, we created a Team Charter to establish a shared understanding of our goals, working styles, communication expectations, and responsibilities. These tools and agreements helped us maintain transparency, accountability, and effective collaboration throughout the project.</p>
