                <p>In our project, we adopted an agile methodology for its flexibility and iterative nature, enabling us to adapt to changing requirements and stakeholder feedback. Regular sprint planning sessions helped us define goals and tasks, keeping us aligned with project objectives. Initially, we used Trello for task management but transitioned to Jira after feedback from our coaches, recognizing its advanced features for sprint planning, backlog organization, and task tracking, which better align with industry standards.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To foster effective collaboration, we created a Team Charter outlining shared goals, communication expectations, and responsibilities. These tools and agreements ensured transparency, accountability, and smooth teamwork throughout the project.</p>

                <p>To ground our concept in real user needs, we began with a combination of desk research and field interviews to better understand the lived experiences of individuals with ADHD, particularly regarding digital accessibility. We also held discussions with our client, Studio Krom, to ensure our direction aligned with their mission of promoting inclusive design.</p><br>
                <p>In our efforts to recruit participants, I explored multiple avenues. I first reached out to Student+ at Fontys, but due to privacy restrictions, they were unable to provide access to diagnosed individuals. I also attempted to connect through an ADHD-focused subreddit, but the post was removed due to platform rules. Additionally, I contacted a local Eindhoven organization, ADHD Café, hoping to attend a session for informal conversations, but did not receive a response.</p><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Through my research, I discovered that individuals with ADHD often experience a heightened sensitivity to visual stimuli. This can lead to feelings of overwhelm and difficulty focusing when faced with cluttered or chaotic digital environments. I also learned that many people with ADHD have developed their own coping mechanisms to manage these challenges, such as using specific apps or tools to help them stay organized and focused. To better understand these results and put them into a format that I could easily refer back to, I created an empathy map and an affinity map.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Based on our research findings, we identified visual overload, lack of structure, and limited user control as key challenges for individuals with ADHD. In response, we shaped our concept around principles of clarity, flexibility, and simplicity. This led to concrete design choices such as using clean layouts with limited simultaneous visual stimuli and distractions, incorporating collapsible components to reduce distraction, and allowing users to hopefully be able to evntually customize their interface based on personal needs. These decisions were presented to Studio Krom during a mid-project check-in, where we explained how each feature directly addressed user pain points. The client responded positively, and our user-centered approach guided the refinement of the final concept.</p>

                <h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Throughout the project, we remained mindful of ethical considerations by ensuring informed consent during interviews and anonymizing participant data to protect privacy. We also respected varying levels of openness around neurodivergence—recognizing that while some individuals were comfortable sharing their experiences, others preferred discretion. Interculturally, we aimed to create a design that was inclusive and sensitive to different communication styles and accessibility needs, avoiding assumptions based on one cultural or cognitive perspective. From a sustainability standpoint, our solution encourages more mindful and efficient use of digital platforms by reducing cognitive load, which can help minimize screen fatigue and promote healthier digital habits.</p>

                <p>To maintain a professional relationship with our client, Studio Krom, we held biweekly check-ins to keep them informed about our progress and gather feedback. I took on the communication role within our team, serving as the main point of contact with Joris from Krom. This involved managing scheduling, sharing updates, and coordinating meetings through WhatsApp and email. As a team, we made a consistent effort to show up prepared — always punctual, fully present, and organized. To ensure a focused environment for these sessions, we proactively booked meeting rooms rather than using the often noisy OIL space. We also prepared visual presentations to clearly communicate our work and facilitate productive discussions. </p>
