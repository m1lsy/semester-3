                <h2>Playground Convention</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>On March 20th, we had the amazing opportunity to attend the Playgrounds Art Department festival in Strijp-S. Events like these are always a highlight for me, much like Design Week and other art-focused conventions, as I love learning about the creative processes of different artists. I find these events incredibly inspiring.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Initially, when looking at the schedule, nothing in particular stood out to me since this convention seemed to be heavily focused on animation and game design—areas that are not my typical fields of interest. However, I did some research beforehand to see which interviews and talks I wanted to attend.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After exploring the market, bookstore, and various small stands—including a display of 3D work from Breda University of Applied Sciences and some interesting drawing areas—I attended my first talk of the day, given by a popular Instagram artist called Feefal. Before her talk, I had checked out her work and felt that it wasn’t exactly my taste. However, I decided to attend anyway to hear more about her process.</p>

                <h2>Playground Convention</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>To my surprise, I found her talk incredibly engaging. Normally, I tend to zone out during lectures, but the format of these talks was short and to the point, keeping me captivated the entire time. Hearing Feefal discuss her creative process and offer tips for young artists was truly insightful. Although I don’t draw as often these days, I was an art student in high school, and her talk reignited my old passion for it. One of my favorite lines from her talk was when she said that you don’t have to be the best in the industry to pursue something—you just need to find your own style and develop something unique.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, I attended a talk by Marlon Nowe, an animator who has worked on huge projects such as Frozen, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, and Overwatch 2. Even though I have never pursued animation myself, his journey to landing his dream job at Disney was both captivating and inspiring. Seeing the animation process behind these beloved films—from the initial wireframe sketches to the detailed final versions—was fascinating.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After a short break, I attended an incredible talk by Nomada Studios, where they walked us through the creative process behind Neva, their beautifully crafted game. What stood out the most was how each frame is meticulously hand-illustrated, giving the game a truly unique and artistic feel. It was inspiring to see the amount of passion and detail that goes into their work, making Neva not just a game, but a moving piece of art. This talk in particular opened my mind up to game design and how versatile it actually can be. This talk was probably the highlight of the day!</p>
                <br>
                <p>To wrap up the day, I attended an interview with Rolf Te Booij, a special effects expert and prop maker. His work was incredibly creepy yet realistic, and I found it intriguing on a personal level, even though it wasn’t directly relevant to my studies.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>On April 17th, we had the opportunity to attend a career day at the Fontys TQ campus in Strijp S, Eindhoven. This event was particularly exciting for me as it was my first time attending a career day, and I was eager to explore potential internship opportunitiesn aswell as learn more about the options to choose for specilizations.</p>
                <br>  
                <p>During the event, I had the chance to chat with some of the teachers about the specilizations that I was intrested in and ask some questions which I had thought of. It was also a great opportunity to network and learn more about what they were looking for in potential candidates for internships, even though this is only in Semester 5.</p><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>On May 21st, I attended the Fontys IT Festival, which was a fantastic opportunity to connect with my fellow students aswell as my teachers and learn more about the latest trends in technology. The event featured a variety of project showcases including games and workshops, and was a very fun day!</p><br>
                <p>One of the highlights for me was the opportunity to play some of the games that my fellow students had created. It was impressive to see the level of creativity and skill on display, and it was a great way to unwind and have some fun after a busy semester.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, the Fontys IT Festival was a great way to celebrate the end of the semester and connect with my peers in a relaxed and enjoyable setting.

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Throughout the semester, I made a conscious effort to proactively seek feedback from my peers, project coaches, and clients. I approached them regularly to discuss my work, ask for constructive criticism, and gain insights into areas where I could improve.</p><br>
                <p>This proactive approach allowed me to identify my strengths and weaknesses more effectively and take deliberate actions to address them. By actively engaging in conversations and asking targeted questions, I was able to gain valuable perspectives that helped me refine my skills and grow both personally and professionally.</p><br>
                <p>Seeking feedback also demonstrated my willingness to learn and adapt, which is a key aspect of personal leadership. It enabled me to stay focused on continuous improvement and make informed decisions that align with my goals and values.</p>

This is the first award that I have won during my studies and all though it is small, it has really given me the motivation that I was looking for to keep working hard. It also has shown me that I am smarter than I think and that my ideas have the potentional to succeed if I work hard.</p><br>

                <p>Throughout this semester, I have made significant progress in my personal growth.

                <p>Additionally, I have become more proactive in seeking out opportunities for personal and professional development.

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Attending various events this semester and making important decisions, such as choosing a specialization, has prompted me to seriously consider the direction I want to take in my career. While this has always been in the back of my mind, it is becoming increasingly significant as I progress in my studies.</p><br>
                <p>Throughout the semester, I experienced moments of self-doubt regarding my abilities and choices—something I had never encountered before. Typically, I am a motivated and enthusiastic person who believes I can achieve anything I set my mind to. However, I found myself questioning whether this study was the right fit for me or if I was capable enough to succeed.</p><br>
                <p>Through conversations with fellow students, I came to understand that such doubts are completely normal. These discussions reassured me that I am indeed capable of succeeding in this study. I realized that finding my niche (identifying the areas I enjoy and excel in) will be key to my success.</p><br>
                <p>After attending the career day and speaking with my teachers, I have decided to focus on UX/UI design. This realization has led me to choose Mobile Development as my specialization, as it will allow me to delve deeper into designing interfaces and front-end development. This topic really excites me as desiging my portfolio and developing it has always been the highlight of my semesters so far. I believe this area aligns best with my skills and interests, and I am excited to explore it further in the coming semesters.</p><br>
