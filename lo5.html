            </div>

                <p>On March 20th, we had the amazing opportunity to attend the Playgrounds Art Department festival in Strijp-S. Events like these are always a highlight for me, much like Design Week and other art-focused conventions, as I love learning about the creative processes of different artists. I find these events incredibly inspiring.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Initially, when looking at the schedule, nothing in particular stood out to me since this convention seemed to be heavily focused on animation and game design—areas that are not my typical fields of interest. However, I did some research beforehand to see which interviews and talks I wanted to attend.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After exploring the market, bookstore, and various small stands—including a display of 3D work from Breda University of Applied Sciences and some interesting drawing areas—I attended my first talk of the day, given by a popular Instagram artist called Feefal. Before her talk, I had checked out her work and felt that it wasn’t exactly my taste. However, I decided to attend anyway to hear more about her process.</p>

                <h2>Playground Convention</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>To my surprise, I found her talk incredibly engaging. Normally, I tend to zone out during lectures, but the format of these talks was short and to the point, keeping me captivated the entire time. Hearing Feefal discuss her creative process and offer tips for young artists was truly insightful. Although I don’t draw as often these days, I was an art student in high school, and her talk reignited my old passion for it. One of my favorite lines from her talk was when she said that you don’t have to be the best in the industry to pursue something—you just need to find your own style and develop something unique.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, I attended a talk by Marlon Nowe, an animator who has worked on huge projects such as Frozen, Tangled, Wreck-It Ralph, and Overwatch 2. Even though I have never pursued animation myself, his journey to landing his dream job at Disney was both captivating and inspiring. Seeing the animation process behind these beloved films—from the initial wireframe sketches to the detailed final versions—was fascinating.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After a short break, I attended an incredible talk by Nomada Studios, where they walked us through the creative process behind Neva, their beautifully crafted game. What stood out the most was how each frame is meticulously hand-illustrated, giving the game a truly unique and artistic feel. It was inspiring to see the amount of passion and detail that goes into their work, making Neva not just a game, but a moving piece of art. This talk in particular opened my mind up to game design and how versatile it actually can be. This talk was probably the highlight of the day!</p>
                <br>
                <p>To wrap up the day, I attended an interview with Rolf Te Booij, a special effects expert and prop maker. His work was incredibly creepy yet realistic, and I found it intriguing on a personal level, even though it wasn’t directly relevant to my studies.</p>
