            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>When I set out to design my portfolio, I began by researching current design trends and gathering inspiration from platforms like Awwwards and Dribbble. This helped me ensure that my work felt contemporary and in line with modern expectations for layout, navigation, and overall visual presentation. I was particularly drawn to websites like Komma and Stefan Vitasovic for their clean, minimal, and elegant design language — something that strongly resonates with my personal aesthetic.</p><br>
                <p>I approached my portfolio as a visual presentation rather than a traditional document. I wanted it to feel immersive and curated, placing emphasis on large imagery and thoughtful composition, rather than overwhelming text or dense case studies. To me, a portfolio should act as a showcase — a reflection of both the work I’ve done and the kind of designer I aspire to be.</p><br>
                <p>My goal was for viewers, especially potential employers or collaborators, to immediately understand my design sensibility: modern, minimal, and user-focused. While minimal design can sometimes be seen as a risky choice — potentially perceived as too simple — I believe it requires strong UI and UX decision-making to execute effectively. I aim to make each interaction feel intentional and polished, balancing clarity with creativity.</p><br>
                <p>I began sketching out ideas in Figma, experimenting with layout, typography, and user flow, allowing the design to evolve organically from those early explorations. The result is a portfolio that not only showcases my work but also serves as a clear statement of the type of design I’m passionate about.</p><br>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>After finalizing the design, I moved on to the development phase. I chose to build my portfolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as I wanted to keep it lightweight and easily maintainable. In order to keep a structured layout, I built the entire portfolio on grids to position everything very precisely.</p><br>
                <p>I built my portfolio around a main, dynamic tile page which displays the sections of my portfolio in a new, exciting way than I have done before. Each tile is interactive, providing subtle animations and hover effects to enhance user engagement and make the experience more immersive.</p><br>
                <p>Additionally, I optimized the portfolio for performance by minimizing image sizes, leveraging modern CSS techniques, and ensuring efficient JavaScript execution. This helped improve load times and overall usability.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, the development process was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply my design skills in a practical context while also learning more about web development best practices. It was an opportunity to merge creativity with technical expertise, resulting in a portfolio that truly represents my capabilities as a designer and developer.</p><br>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Reflecting on the process of creating my portfolio, I realize how much I’ve grown as a designer and developer. This project was not just about showcasing my work; it was an opportunity to express my design philosophy and technical skills in a cohesive manner.</p><br>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was ensuring that the design remained true to my vision while also being functional and user-friendly. Balancing aesthetics with usability is always a delicate dance, but I believe I managed to create a portfolio that is both visually appealing and easy to navigate.</p><br>
                <p>After learning React and tailwind CSS for my group project, I wish I had learned it earlier so that I could use it in my portfolio instead of just vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, but now I am excited for next semester when I can use these new skills that I have learned to create an even better portfolio!</p><br>
