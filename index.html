                <p>The challenge was to create and brand ourselves as a full digital studio, ready to engage with real-world clients. We were tasked with developing a unique studio name, defining the type of studio we wanted to be, and building a cohesive brand identity that would represent our values and skills in the digital space.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>We initially set up a Trello board to split tasks among group members, but after receiving feedback from our coaches, we switched to Jira, recognizing it as a more professional tool for task management. We then created a Team Contract to discuss our strengths and weaknesses, as well as establish rules for attendance and communication, ensuring that we worked in a professional and organized manner.</p>
