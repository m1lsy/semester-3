            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>The challenge was to create and brand ourselves as a full digital studio, ready to engage with real-world clients. We were tasked with developing a unique studio name, defining the type of studio we wanted to be, and building a cohesive brand identity that would represent our values and skills in the digital space.</p>

                <h2>To Start</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>We initially set up a Trello board to split tasks among group members, but after receiving feedback from our coaches, we switched to Jira, recognizing it as a more professional tool for task management. We then created a Team Contract to discuss our strengths and weaknesses, as well as establish rules for attendance and communication, ensuring that we worked in a professional and organized manner.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I then began defining the brand's core values to create a strong foundation for the design elements, ensuring they aligned with the brand’s identity and message.</p>

                <h2>Design</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>After defining the core values, I began designing the logo. My goal was to create a modern, minimalist design that was both impactful and more creative than a simple text-based logo. I drew inspiration from Pinterest, exploring the use of positive and negative space. To organize my ideas, I compiled my inspirations and color palette into a stylescape to present to my group.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After receiving feedback and reviewing my team members' designs, I began exploring new logo ideas, focusing on the core value of 'adaptability' and conveying a sense of 'flexibility'. Drawing inspiration from the logos in my stylescape, I experimented with negative space to create more dynamic and visually engaging designs. To refine my concepts and enhance my proficiency with professional tools, I developed these logos using Adobe Illustrator and they can be seen below in the first blueprint image. </p>
                <br>
                <p>After some discussion, our team decided to slightly shift the direction of our studio’s branding. We realized that our current branding lacked individuality, so we chose to incorporate a <b>chameleon as our mascot</b>—a symbol of adaptability and versatility. With this new focus, I revisited the logo design process, experimenting with ways to integrate the chameleon into our visual identity which is seen below in the second blueprint image. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Once we had each completed our stylescapes and logo concepts, I took the initiative to develop a cohesive <b>color palette</b> for our brand. We initially gravitated toward <b>blue tones</b>, as we felt they best represented our studio’s identity. However, each of our palettes featured unique shades of blue paired with different accent colors. </p>
                <br>
                <p>While refining the final palette, I carefully combined elements from each of our designs to create a balanced and distinctive look. Although our mascot was a chameleon, we intentionally avoided using green, as it felt too predictable and lacked the originality we wanted for our brand.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>After extensive iteration and discussion, we decided on a logo designed by one of my teammates, as it best captured our brand’s identity and character. To ensure consistency across all branding elements, I collaborated with a teammate to develop a comprehensive brand guide. This guide outlined our logo usage, typography, color palette, design elements, and overall visual direction, serving as a foundation for maintaining a cohesive and professional brand identity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I also created some poster options for the brand and made the motivational document to send to the client.</p>
