            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>The challenge was to create and brand ourselves as a full digital studio, ready to engage with real-world clients. We were tasked with developing a unique studio name, defining the type of studio we wanted to be, and building a cohesive brand identity that would represent our values and skills in the digital space.</p>

                <h2>To Start</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>We initially set up a Trello board to split tasks among group members, but after receiving feedback from our coaches, we switched to Jira, recognizing it as a more professional tool for task management. We then created a Team Contract to discuss our strengths and weaknesses, as well as establish rules for attendance and communication, ensuring that we worked in a professional and organized manner.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I then began defining the brand's core values to create a strong foundation for the design elements, ensuring they aligned with the brandâ€™s identity and message.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>After defining the core values, I began designing the logo. My goal was to create a modern, minimalist design that was both impactful and more creative than a simple text-based logo. I drew inspiration from Pinterest, exploring the use of positive and negative space. To organize my ideas, I compiled my inspirations and color palette into a stylescape to present to my group.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After receiving feedback and reviewing my team members' designs, I began exploring new logo ideas, focusing on the core value of 'adaptability' and conveying a sense of 'flexibility'. Drawing inspiration from the logos in my stylescape, I experimented with negative space to create more dynamic and visually engaging designs. To refine my concepts and enhance my proficiency with professional tools, I developed these logos using Adobe Illustrator. </p>
