                <p>Accessibility is a broad and multifaceted topic, offering countless directions to explore. As a team, we quickly realized that trying to tackle the entire umbrella of accessibility would be overwhelming and difficult. We wanted to narrow it down to an aspect that felt personally relevant and potentially overlooked in mainstream conversations. This led us to focus on ADHD—a condition that affects many people in our age group and immediate circles. Despite its prevalence, ADHD is often underrepresented in discussions around digital accessibility, making it a meaningful and impactful area for us to explore together with Studio Krom.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>To kick off our project, we conducted library research alongside a series of interviews (field research) with individuals who have ADHD. Our goal was to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and the challenges they face—especially in relation to digital accessibility. We also reached out to our client, Studio Krom, to gather their perspective and align on the direction of the project. </p>
                <br>
                <p>To find participants for our interviews, I reached out to several sources. I first contacted Student+ at Fontys, but they were unable to assist due to privacy policies preventing them from sharing names of individuals with a diagnosis. I also tried posting in a relevant Reddit forum, but unfortunately, the post was removed by a moderator as research-related requests weren't allowed. Lastly, I contacted a local group in Eindhoven called ADHD Café, asking if I could attend a meeting to ask a few questions, but I didn’t receive a response. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite these setbacks, I was still able to connect with individuals from my own network who were open to sharing their experiences. These conversations provided valuable insights and played a key role in shaping our understanding of the challenges faced by people with ADHD.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Through my research, I discovered that individuals with ADHD often experience a heightened sensitivity to visual stimuli. This can lead to feelings of overwhelm and difficulty focusing when faced with cluttered or chaotic digital environments. I also learned that many people with ADHD have developed their own coping mechanisms to manage these challenges, such as using specific apps or tools to help them stay organized and focused. To better understand these results and put them into a format that I could easily refer back to, I created an <b>empathy map</b> and an <b>affinity map.</b></p>

                <p>The next step in our project was designing a poster to display our concept to our peers aswell as explain who our client was and give some background to the poster. I created my first poster design on Adobe Illustrator and filled it up with all the information that I felt was important, in a way that looked visually appealling. Although the information was all there, I felt that there was too much text and it was missing some visuals, so I saught feedback from Dirk.</p>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>After receiving feedback, I decided to completely redesign the poster. I drew inspiration from both my teammates’ designs and my own, experimenting with different layouts until I landed on one that felt cohesive and visually striking. One of the ideas I explored was an interactive, two-layered poster: the bottom layer contained detailed text, while the top layer simplified that information for easier reading. While this concept aligned well with our overall message, I felt it misrepresented the project by highlighting just one small aspect of it and ultimately lacked the visual impact I was aiming for.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After our poster presentation, my team and I met with our client, Studio Krom, to showcase the poster, walk them through our concept development, and discuss potential features for Center. I co-presented with a teammate using a PowerPoint presentation to visually illustrate each feature, helping the client better understand our direction. The feedback we received was both encouraging and insightful, providing valuable input for our next steps.

All of the features you proposed were strong, but my advice is to focus on the web page condenser and the Pomodoro timer. Keep in mind the 'Swiss Army Knife Complex'—sometimes having too many features can dilute the impact. I recommend combining the stopwatch with the Pomodoro timer since they’re both time-based, and consider removing the note taker and task tracker, as they may not be necessary. Overall, really great work—I’m excited about this project!"</h5>

                <p>After presenting the poster, I shifted my focus to designing the interface. I started by creating a moodboard to establish the overall look and feel of the design. I then sketched out some initial ideas for the layout and functionality of the interface, considering how to best present the information in a clear and engaging way.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once I had a solid concept in mind, I began creating wireframes to map out the structure and flow of the interface. This helped me visualize how users would navigate through the content and interact with different elements aswell as what elements each feature would have.</p>
