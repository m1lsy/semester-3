                <p>Accessibility is a broad and multifaceted topic, offering countless directions to explore. As a team, we quickly realized that trying to tackle the entire umbrella of accessibility would be overwhelming and difficult. We wanted to narrow it down to an aspect that felt personally relevant and potentially overlooked in mainstream conversations. This led us to focus on ADHD—a condition that affects many people in our age group and immediate circles. Despite its prevalence, ADHD is often underrepresented in discussions around digital accessibility, making it a meaningful and impactful area for us to explore together with Studio Krom.</p>

                <p>To kick off our project, we conducted library research alongside a series of interviews with individuals who have ADHD. Our goal was to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences and the challenges they face—especially in relation to digital accessibility. We also reached out to our client, Studio Krom, to gather their perspective and align on the direction of the project. This collaborative and research-driven approach allowed us to collect a range of insights and ensure our work was grounded in real-life experiences.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To find participants for our interviews, I reached out to several sources. I first contacted Student+ at Fontys, but they were unable to assist due to privacy policies preventing them from sharing names of individuals with a diagnosis. I also tried posting in a relevant Reddit forum, but unfortunately, the post was removed by a moderator as research-related requests weren't allowed. Lastly, I contacted a local group in Eindhoven called ADHD Café, asking if I could attend a meeting to ask a few questions, but I didn’t receive a response. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite these setbacks, I was still able to connect with individuals from my own network who were open to sharing their experiences. These conversations provided valuable insights and played a key role in shaping our understanding of the challenges faced by people with ADHD.</p>
