                <p>For this project, I structured my design and development process using the Double Diamond framework. This approach helped me navigate the complexity of digital accessibility for people with ADHD by breaking the work into clear, iterative phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.</p><br>
                <p>DISCOVER: I began with broad research to understand accessibility challenges related to ADHD, combining library research with field interviews to gather qualitative insights.</p><br>
                <p>DEFINE: Insights from research were synthesized into empathy and affinity maps, helping to identify specific user needs and pain points.</p><br>
                <p>DEVELOP: Based on these findings, I created initial concepts and visual designs, which were then refined through multiple iterations guided by user and peer feedback.</p><br>
                <p>DELIVER: The final phase involved polishing the visual and interaction design, incorporating validation from testing and expert feedback to ensure the solution was effective and accessible.</p><br>
                <P>Using this framework kept the process focused and user-centered, allowing me to validate each step with real input and adapt the design meaningfully before moving forward. To see each step in the progress in more detail, please refer to the Krom project page:</P><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Developing the visual identity for Studio Myo started with a clear goal: to design a logo and brand guide that reflected our studio’s values — especially adaptability — in a clean and professional way. I began my initial logo exploration, using minimalist forms and negative space. Throughout the process, we gathered feedback, discussed as a team, and refined the direction based on what did and didn’t resonate. This led to a significant shift in concept, where we introduced a chameleon as a symbol of adaptability. The following images show how the logo evolved through feedback, iteration, and testing. </p><br>
                <p>1) To begin my design process, I created a stylescape to show my teammates what vibe I envisioned for Studio Myo. This stylescape included logo ideas, typography and colour palettes.</p><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>2) After sharing stylescapes with each other, I moved to my first logo design which focused on minimalist, abstract forms that represented flexibility and flow. Inspired by negative space logos as seen in the stylescape, I aimed for a versatile logo that could adapt across digital platforms. However, feedback from my teammates showed that it felt too generic and didn’t fully express our studio’s unique personality.</p><br>
                <p>3) I refined the shapes and explored more distinctive layouts. Although the design was more structured, it still lacked emotional connection or a recognizable symbol. This pushed us to re-evaluate our visual identity on a deeper level.</p><br>
                <p>4) After a team discussion, we decided to introduce a chameleon as a visual metaphor for adaptability — our brand's core value. This sparked a new wave of logo exploration. I began experimenting with chameleon silhouettes and stylized forms while keeping the design clean and modern.</p>

                <p>5) The final design merged simplicity with symbolism. The chameleon logo not only stood out but also aligned with our values and tone. Although my logo was not selected, my iteration process was still meaningful and added elements to the final logo. We tested the in various contexts (website, posters, small sizes) to ensure it was scalable, legible, and professional.</p>
