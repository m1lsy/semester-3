            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>For this project, I structured my design and development process using the Double Diamond framework. This approach helped me navigate the complexity of digital accessibility for people with ADHD by breaking the work into clear, iterative phases: Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.</p><br>
                <p>DISCOVER: I began with broad research to understand accessibility challenges related to ADHD, combining library research with field interviews to gather qualitative insights.</p><br>
                <p>DEFINE: Insights from research were synthesized into empathy and affinity maps, helping to identify specific user needs and pain points.</p><br>
                <p>DEVELOP: Based on these findings, I created initial concepts and visual designs, which were then refined through multiple iterations guided by user and peer feedback.</p><br>
                <p>DELIVER: The final phase involved polishing the visual and interaction design, incorporating validation from testing and expert feedback to ensure the solution was effective and accessible.</p><br>
                <P>Using this framework kept the process focused and user-centered, allowing me to validate each step with real input and adapt the design meaningfully before moving forward. To see each step in the progress in more detail, please refer to the Krom project page:</P><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Developing the visual identity for Studio Myo started with a clear goal: to design a logo and brand guide that reflected our studio’s values — especially adaptability — in a clean and professional way. I began my initial logo exploration, using minimalist forms and negative space. Throughout the process, we gathered feedback, discussed as a team, and refined the direction based on what did and didn’t resonate. This led to a significant shift in concept, where we introduced a chameleon as a symbol of adaptability. The following images show how the logo evolved through feedback, iteration, and testing. </p><br>
                <p>1) To begin my design process, I created a stylescape to show my teammates what vibe I envisioned for Studio Myo. This stylescape included logo ideas, typography and colour palettes.</p><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>2) After sharing stylescapes with each other, I moved to my first logo design which focused on minimalist, abstract forms that represented flexibility and flow. Inspired by negative space logos as seen in the stylescape, I aimed for a versatile logo that could adapt across digital platforms. However, feedback from my teammates showed that it felt too generic and didn’t fully express our studio’s unique personality.</p><br>
                <p>3) I refined the shapes and explored more distinctive layouts. Although the design was more structured, it still lacked emotional connection or a recognizable symbol. This pushed us to re-evaluate our visual identity on a deeper level.</p><br>
                <p>4) After a team discussion, we decided to introduce a chameleon as a visual metaphor for adaptability — our brand's core value. This sparked a new wave of logo exploration. I began experimenting with chameleon silhouettes and stylized forms while keeping the design clean and modern.</p>

                <p>5) The final design merged simplicity with symbolism. The chameleon logo not only stood out but also aligned with our values and tone. Although my logo was not selected, my iteration process was still meaningful and added elements to the final logo. We tested the in various contexts (website, posters, small sizes) to ensure it was scalable, legible, and professional.</p>

                <p>For our Center project with Studio Krom, my design process focused on two key deliverables: the conecpt/ awareness campaign poster and the timer feature interface. The poster design underwent several iterations, evolving from initial designs which were too text heavy to the final impactful design which was a collabortion with a teammate. Each iteration refined the message and visual impact, incorporating feedback from both our team and teachers to ensure the posters effectively communicated the challenges of digital accessibility for people with ADHD.</p><br>

                <p>Initially, my poster design was overly text-heavy, making it challenging to read and understand at a glance. After receiving feedback from Dirk and my teammates, I re-evaluated my approach. The 'text-heavy' poster itself highlighted the very issue we aimed to address with our browser extension—how overwhelming dense text can be for individuals with ADHD. This inspired a new idea: to use the text-heavy poster as an example of the problem, paired with a redesigned version that presented the same information in a simplified and more accessible way.</p><br>

            <div class="aside-text"> 
                <p>The timer feature, which was my primary responsibility in the project, went through multiple design iterations in Figma. Starting with basic wireframes, I explored different ways to make time management more intuitive and less overwhelming for users with ADHD, while sticking to the UI style to match the main console. I did this by looking at other pomodoro timer apps and seeing how they desigined their interfaces, such as 'Interval Timer' and 'FocusPomo'. Initial designs featured just a pomodoro timer, but after user testing we learnt that despite research showing pomodoro is optimal for concentration, some people prefer to use just a stop watch.</p><br>
                <p>So we decided to allow the user to be able to pick which timer to use based on their needs. Initially this was done with a toggle feature as seen in the early iterations below. </p>

                <p>After reviewing the first two designs, I shared my thoughts with my teammates regarding the use of all-lowercase text. While some group members preferred this style, I felt it lacked a professional appearance and needed refinement. Additionally, although the font Lexend was chosen based on research highlighting its suitability for individuals with ADHD, I believed it was better suited for large blocks of text rather than interface elements. I suggested switching to standard capitalization and opting for a simpler, UI-focused font to enhance the overall design.</p><br>
                <p>It was also brought to my attention by Chris that the large toggle at the top of the page did not really match the styling of the rest of the console and to rethink how I could do this.</p>

                <p>Before changing the design, I quickly expriemented with using colour to indicate focus period of break period. I did this by using soft, muted colours to try and keep to the styling of the rest of the interface. However, I felt that this was still not quite right and did not work with the neumorphism style we were going for.</p><br>

                <p>In this new design, I changed the navigation of the timer and moved the settings toggle to the navigation bar too as I felt this made more sence and made the bottom icons less cluttered.

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>In this final iteration, I added colour to the timer feature to enhance usability and visual appeal. I chnaged the colour of the play and pause buttons to make them more visable and removed the bottom settings button which was unnessessary as it was now in the nav bar.</p><br>
                <p>After testing this design with some users, it was brought to my attnetion that the concept of the "Snooze" button was quite misleading as the feature is for extending the work period instead of taking a break, but the word "Snooze" implies sleep which made them think it was a prolonged break instead. This feedback was very benificial and true, and so we decided to change the concept of this snooze feature altogether and take it out.</p><br>
                <p>The reason we took it out instead of renaming it was beacuase we felt that it was quite contriducting of our research to have a snooze feature. Our research stated that interval working was benifical and allowing the user to work for longer periods was going against this idea.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, the iterative design process for both the poster and timer feature allowed me to refine my ideas based on feedback, leading to more effective and user-centered solutions. I am very happy with the outcome of the timer interface as I think it looks really sleek and proffesional, and reflects my minimal design style.</p><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>My portfolio design process began with extensive research into contemporary design trends, particularly focusing on award-winning websites from platforms like Awwwards and Dribbble. I was especially inspired by minimalist portfolios like Komma and Stefan Vitasovic, which aligned with my personal design aesthetic of clean, elegant interfaces.</p><br>
                <p>To start, I made a list of what I wanted in my portfolio to keep an end goal in mind through the entire design process. I also started collecting colour pallette inspiration and making a list of the websites I liked. </p>
                <p>My initial iterations in Figma explored various hero page design ideas and colour pallettes, aswell as random screenshots from diffent websites I was drawn to in order to surround myself with inspiration.</p>

                <p>Next, I began to brainstorm ideas for a hero page. Based on my previous portfolios, I tend to lean towards having my name in large text taking up the entire screen, and so this was my initial idea. I wanted the hero page to make a strong first impression, reflecting my design style and personality while being visually striking and memorable.</p><br>
                <p>To refine this concept, I explored different typography styles, font weights, colours and layouts to ensure the text was both bold and elegant. </p><br>

                <p>So, I decided to go in a new direction of not having a typical hero page, but rather trying to find a creative way to display my work instead.</p>

                <p>In one of the above iterations (Frame 10), I experimented with a grid layout that would allow me to showcase my projects in a more dynamic way. I wanted to create a visually engaging experience that would draw users in and encourage them to explore my work.</p><br>
                <p>To achieve this, I played with different grid configurations, spacing, and thought about how I could add hover effects to make the project tiles interactive and visually appealing. I also started thinking about how to incorporate animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.</p><br>
                <p>After receiving feedback from my peers, I realized that the grid layout was a step in the right direction, but it still needed refinement to ensure it was both functional and aesthetically pleasing.</p><br>
                <p>In Frame 11, I began to experiment with how I could display my text and headings on the project pages. I tend to write a lot of information, so I wanted to think of a dynamic way to dispay and space out the text so that it was not overcrowed and did not look like an essay. I decided to further iterate on this idea and create a set of wireframes to experiemnt with the layout and have something to refer back to when coding. </p>

                <p>Overall, my portfolio design process was iterative and collaborative, allowing me to refine my ideas and create a final product that I am proud of. I am excited to continue developing new portfolios in the future and explore my personal style as a designer as I gain more experience and skills in web design.</p><br>
