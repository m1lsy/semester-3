                <p>Before working on the Krom project, I had no experience with frameworks. When my team decided to use React, I saw it as the perfect opportunity to learn something new.</p><br>
                <p>I began by exploring the official React documentation, which provided a solid foundation. I then tried following a YouTube tutorial to build a basic to-do list application, but the fast pace left me confused and with many unanswered questions.</p><br>
                <p>Realizing I needed a different approach, I turned to my brother, a recent ICT graduate, for guidance. He patiently explained the basics of React, helped me set up everything correctly using the terminal, and introduced me to Tailwind CSS, which simplified styling immensely.</p><br>
                <p>He also suggested that instead of creating a basic to-do list, I should work on a project that genuinely interested me. Taking his advice, I decided to build a simple movie logging website. This project allowed users to add movies, rate them, and write reviews, giving me a fun and engaging way to practice and deepen my understanding of React.</p><br>

                <p>Reflecting back on this semester, I really do regret not doing more of my own side projects. Although I feel that through creating my portfolio webiste, teaching myself React and building an amazing browser extension was a great learning experience and taught me a lot, I still wish I had made more of an effoer to expiriment with new concepts in my own time. I think the reason I did not do this was because the start of the semester really lacked any development lectures which kind of made me forget about this aspect and concentrate on other aspects such as UX and Research.</p><br>
                <p>When the lectures were finally offered, I felt a lot of them were not topics that were particularly intresting to me and so I sat out of many of them and chose to work on my group project instead. Although I was still using this time to work on other stuff, I regret not forcing myself to go as I need to learn these concepts even if they do not intrest me.</p><br>
                <p>Working on this project not only improved my coding skills but also boosted my confidence in using frameworks. It was rewarding to see the application come together and function as intended.</p><br>
