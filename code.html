                <p>Before working on the Krom project, I had no experience with frameworks. When my team decided to use React, I saw it as the perfect opportunity to learn something new.</p><br>
                <p>I began by exploring the official React documentation, which provided a solid foundation. I then tried following a YouTube tutorial to build a basic to-do list application, but the fast pace left me confused and with many unanswered questions.</p><br>
                <p>Realizing I needed a different approach, I turned to my brother, a recent ICT graduate, for guidance. He patiently explained the basics of React, helped me set up everything correctly using the terminal, and introduced me to Tailwind CSS, which simplified styling immensely.</p><br>
                <p>He also suggested that instead of creating a basic to-do list, I should work on a project that genuinely interested me. Taking his advice, I decided to build a simple movie logging website. This project allowed users to add movies, rate them, and write reviews, giving me a fun and engaging way to practice and deepen my understanding of React.</p><br>
