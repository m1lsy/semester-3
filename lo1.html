            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Over the course of the semester, I developed two major concepts: Studio Myo and Center, each reflecting a different approach to interactive media creation through user-centered design, brand identity, and targeted problem-solving.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h6>Studio Myo – Branding with Purpose</h6>
                <br>
                <p>Studio Myo is a digital studio focused on innovation, quality, efficiency, and adaptability. It aims to create fresh, engaging experiences that push the boundaries of design and technology while being ready to evolve with the needs of clients.</p><br>
                <p>Initially, we took the straightforward route of combining our initials to form the name “Myo.” Coincidentally, one of our team members, who speaks Greek, mentioned that “myo” translates to “muscle.” This metaphor for strength initially resonated with us, and we began exploring logo ideas around it. However, as we refined our values, we realized “muscle” didn’t reflect our brand’s personality.</p><br>
                <p>After deeper reflection, we shifted toward a more meaningful symbol: a chameleon. This became our mascot and represented our core values of adaptability, flexibility, and change, qualities essential for a studio focused on innovative, forward-thinking design solutions. This shift in branding demonstrates our ability to evolve an idea into a concept grounded in values, purpose, and audience connection.</p>

            <h6>Center – Addressing Overlooked Accessibility Needs</h6>
                <br>
                <p>For the second project, we collaborated with Krom, a client focused on digital accessibility. We were challenged to design a concept that not only addressed accessibility but also stood out from common approaches, which often focus exclusively on physical disabilities.</p><br>
                <p>Through research and discussion, we realized there was a lack of tools designed for cognitive disabilities, specifically ADHD—a condition affecting many people in our own age group that is often overlooked in accessibility design. We felt strongly about addressing this gap.</p><br>
                <p>Our goal became clear: to design a digital product that made daily life easier for people with ADHD. After exploring different directions, we identified a market gap in browser-based productivity tools. We conceptualized a browser extension that would assist users with task management, focus, and routine-building—offering tangible, everyday support grounded in user needs.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Prototyping</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>To bring our concept to life, I designed a high-fidelity interactive prototype of the browser extension in Figma. Rather than sticking to static wireframes, I explored Figma’s advanced prototyping features to create a simulation that closely mimicked a real extension. This included a functioning countdown timer, interactive dropdown menus, and navigation transitions that gave the feel of an actual browser-based tool. My goal was to create an experience that could be tested and refined to ensuring every element served a real user need.</p><br>
                <p>From the beginning of the design process, I applied key usability heuristics such as visibility of system status (e.g. timer feedback and progress indicators), consistency and standards (by following familiar browser UI patterns), and user control and freedom (clear buttons to pause, reset, or close the extension). These principles helped shape an intuitive and accessible interface from the ground up.</p><br>
                <p>At each major stage (low-fidelity wireframes, early interactive components, and full-feature mockups), I conducted user testing sessions with people from our target audience who had diagnosed ADHD. Their feedback directly influenced each iteration of the design. For example, based on early testing, I reduced visual clutter and added clearer call-to-actions to help users stay focused. </p><br>
                <p>This iterative, user-centered process ensured the prototype wasn’t just functional, but also valid and engaging, aligning with accessibility best practices and supporting the needs of our specific user group. The result was a prototype that not only looked and felt polished but also reflected tested, validated interactions that could translate directly into a real product.</p><br><br>

                <h2> User Testing & Validation</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>As part of the design process for my ADHD-focused browser extension prototype, I carried out user testing to evaluate usability and accessibility for neurodivergent users by conducted a session with a participant diagnosed with ADHD. The goal was to test navigation, how easily users could understand key features, and how intuitive the interface felt overall.</p><br>
                <p>The prototype, designed in Figma, included interactive features like a working Pomodoro-style timer and a dropdown-style menu that mimicked the experience of a real browser extension. At each stage of the design process, from wireframes to a fully functional prototype, I tested and gathered feedback to guide my decisions. I focused on core usability heuristics such as clear system feedback, real-world language, and minimising memory load by keeping important actions visible.</p><br>
                <p>I also documented the entire session in a detailed user testing report, outlining tasks, user behaviour, and recommendations for improvement. To ensure the test was well-structured and insightful, I shared it with a teacher for review. Their feedback confirmed that the report was strong, with clear insights and appropriate focus on the needs of ADHD users:</p><br>

                <p>“This is a really clear and well-structured user testing report. You’ve done a great job documenting the session and drawing out useful insights. Looking at the results, I’d suggest exploring the use of colour—like green for ‘Start’ and red for ‘Stop’—to help with navigation clarity, especially for users with ADHD. Overall, excellent work!” </p>

                <p>The test session highlighted a few small issues—like some hesitation around unclear labels and a lack of feedback when interacting with the timer. Despite that, the user found the interface calming and easy to use, with the minimal layout helping her stay focused. Based on the feedback, I plan to refine labels, add small animations or sound cues for interactivity, and include optional onboarding tips to support first-time users.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, testing confirmed that the design is on the right track for ADHD users and gave me valuable insight into how even small UX improvements can make a big difference in accessibility and usability</p><br><br>
