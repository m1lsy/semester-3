                <h2>Concept Development</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Over the course of the semester, I developed two major concepts: Studio Myo and Center, each reflecting a different approach to interactive media creation through user-centered design, brand identity, and targeted problem-solving.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h6>Studio Myo – Branding with Purpose</h6>
                <br>
                <p>Studio Myo is a digital studio focused on innovation, quality, efficiency, and adaptability. It aims to create fresh, engaging experiences that push the boundaries of design and technology while being ready to evolve with the needs of clients.</p><br>
                <p>Initially, we took the straightforward route of combining our initials to form the name “Myo.” Coincidentally, one of our team members, who speaks Greek, mentioned that “myo” translates to “muscle.” This metaphor for strength initially resonated with us, and we began exploring logo ideas around it. However, as we refined our values, we realized “muscle” didn’t reflect our brand’s personality.</p><br>
                <p>After deeper reflection, we shifted toward a more meaningful symbol: a chameleon. This became our mascot and represented our core values of adaptability, flexibility, and change, qualities essential for a studio focused on innovative, forward-thinking design solutions. This shift in branding demonstrates our ability to evolve an idea into a concept grounded in values, purpose, and audience connection.</p>

            <h6>Center – Addressing Overlooked Accessibility Needs</h6>
                <br>
                <p>For the second project, we collaborated with Krom, a client focused on digital accessibility. We were challenged to design a concept that not only addressed accessibility but also stood out from common approaches, which often focus exclusively on physical disabilities.</p><br>
                <p>Through research and discussion, we realized there was a lack of tools designed for cognitive disabilities, specifically ADHD—a condition affecting many people in our own age group that is often overlooked in accessibility design. We felt strongly about addressing this gap.</p><br>
                <p>Our goal became clear: to design a digital product that made daily life easier for people with ADHD. After exploring different directions, we identified a market gap in browser-based productivity tools. We conceptualized a browser extension that would assist users with task management, focus, and routine-building—offering tangible, everyday support grounded in user needs.</p>

                <h2>Center Concept Overview</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Center is a browser extension designed for individuals with ADHD, aimed at supporting daily focus and task managment while working in the browser. By targeting the specific cognitive challenges faced by ADHD users like distraction, overwhelm, and difficulty with routines, the concept offers an intuitive, calming, and effective interface built on user-centered design and accessibility principles.</p><br>

                <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>The primary target group for the Center browser extention is teenagers and young adults (ages 13–25) diagnosed with ADHD, particularly students and early-career professionals who use online browsers for research or different aspects of their studies. These users often face challenges such as attention management, task switching, and feeling overwhelmed by excessive amounts of text. Our design choices—from minimalist layout to intuitive controls—were made to directly address these cognitive needs, based on both research and direct feedback.</p><br>
                <p>Why did we choose those diagnosed with ADHD? We felt as a team that in the very large topic of 'Digital Accessibility', cognitive disabilities are normally overlooked with most people thinking of physical disabilities like blindness, deafness and motor issues. ADHD is also a problem many individuals in our age group are faced with, especially for me as both of my best friends live with this condition. Thoughout high school, they complained how they were always distracted when working online and so I thought this was the perfect, relevent problem to address.</p>

                <h2>Interactive Prototyping</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>To bring our concept to life, I designed a high-fidelity interactive prototype of the browser extension in Figma. Rather than sticking to static wireframes, I explored Figma’s advanced prototyping features to create a simulation that closely mimicked a real extension. This included a functioning countdown timer, interactive dropdown menus, and navigation transitions that gave the feel of an actual browser-based tool. My goal was to create an experience that could be tested and refined to ensuring every element served a real user need.</p><br>
                <p>From the beginning of the design process, I applied key usability heuristics such as visibility of system status (e.g. timer feedback and progress indicators), consistency and standards (by following familiar browser UI patterns), and user control and freedom (clear buttons to pause, reset, or close the extension). These principles helped shape an intuitive and accessible interface from the ground up.</p><br>
                <p>At each major stage (low-fidelity wireframes, early interactive components, and full-feature mockups), I conducted user testing sessions with people from our target audience who had diagnosed ADHD. Their feedback directly influenced each iteration of the design. For example, based on early testing, I reduced visual clutter and added clearer call-to-actions to help users stay focused. </p><br>
                <p>This iterative, user-centered process ensured the prototype wasn’t just functional, but also valid and engaging, aligning with accessibility best practices and supporting the needs of our specific user group. The result was a prototype that not only looked and felt polished but also reflected tested, validated interactions that could translate directly into a real product.</p><br><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>As part of the design process for my ADHD-focused browser extension prototype, I carried out user testing to evaluate usability and accessibility for neurodivergent users by conducted a session with a participant diagnosed with ADHD. The goal was to test navigation, how easily users could understand key features, and how intuitive the interface felt overall.</p><br>
                <p>The prototype, designed in Figma, included interactive features like a working Pomodoro-style timer and a dropdown-style menu that mimicked the experience of a real browser extension. At each stage of the design process, from wireframes to a fully functional prototype, I tested and gathered feedback to guide my decisions. I focused on core usability heuristics such as clear system feedback, real-world language, and minimising memory load by keeping important actions visible.</p><br>
                <p>I also documented the entire session in a detailed user testing report, outlining tasks, user behaviour, and recommendations for improvement. To ensure the test was well-structured and insightful, I shared it with a teacher for review. Their feedback confirmed that the report was strong, with clear insights and appropriate focus on the needs of ADHD users:</p><br>

Looking at the results, I’d suggest exploring the use of colour—like green for ‘Start’ and red for ‘Stop’—to help with navigation clarity, especially for users with ADHD. Overall, excellent work!” </h5>

                <p>The test session highlighted a few small issues—like some hesitation around unclear labels and a lack of feedback when interacting with the timer. Despite that, the user found the interface calming and easy to use, with the minimal layout helping her stay focused. Based on the feedback, I plan to refine labels, add small animations or sound cues for interactivity, and include optional onboarding tips to support first-time users.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, testing confirmed that the design is on the right track for ADHD users and gave me valuable insight into how even small UX improvements can make a big difference in accessibility and usability.</p><br><br>

            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>During our final demo session where we allowed our fellow students, clinets and teachers to interact with our fully developed browser extention, we observed their interactions and took notes on how they navigated the tool, interpreted labels, and responded to visual feedback.</p><br>
                <p>OBSERVATIONS:</p><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users quickly grasped the purpose of the extension, with many commenting on its over style and were impressed by its functionality.</li><br>
                        <li>Most users understood the Pomodoro timer concept, with several noting its potential to help manage their own focus.</li><br>
                        <li>Some users seemed a bit confused about the main center menu still being open after clicking the AI Summarizer tool, but didn’t realize they had to manually close the main menu to view the full feature. After hesitating, they all figured out to click off but this is something I witnessed with almost every user.</li><br>
                        <li>Overall, users appreciated the calming design and minimal distractions, which helped them stay focused on tasks.</li><br>

            </div>
            <div class="aside-text">
                <p>Working on Studio Myo and Center taught me how to turn ideas into meaningful, user-focused media products. With Studio Myo, I learned that brand identity is more than just visuals—it’s about using design and storytelling to communicate purpose. The chameleon symbol helped us express adaptability in a creative and intentional way.</p><br>
                <p>Center challenged me to think differently about accessibility and pushed me to design with empathy. Through user testing, I realized how small UX decisions can have a big impact on real people’s lives and the final product.</p><br>
                <p>Overall, these projects helped me grow as a designer. I became more confident in my ability to connect ideas with user needs and to create work that’s not just functional—but thoughtful and purposeful. </p>
